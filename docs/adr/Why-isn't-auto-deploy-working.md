# Why isn't auto-deploy working?

This project does not implement a mechanism for automatically deploying blog posts to dev.to.
The reasons are as follows:

- I considered building an automatic deployment mechanism using existing tools such as [devto-cli](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-cli) or [dev-to-git](https://github.com/maxime1992/dev-to-git), but neither package appears to be actively maintained as of the writing of this article.
  - While I also considered creating my own tool based on these libraries, I lack the motivation to do so as I do not frequently use dev.to.
- As of the writing of this article, I do not anticipate frequent posts to dev.to, so manual posting is deemed sufficient (and not a burden).

However, there is a possibility of introducing an automatic deployment mechanism in the future, for example, if a highly reliable package emerges. (Alternatively, I might develop my own tool...)
